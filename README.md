# Smart Home Conceptual Model
A smart home consists of smart devices that are physically connected to controlled equipment, such as heating, lamps, refrigerators, or water systems. These devices operate in an area, such as a room or a garden, that belongs to a real estate property, such as an apartment, building, or land. The smart device can be a commercial off-the-shelf unit or a DIY project composed of different components. 
The brain of the smart home is the controller, which can also be seen as a component itself. The controller communicates with the smart devices and allows you to monitor and manage them remotely.
