# Smart Home Conceptual Model
A smart home consists of smart devices that are physically connected to controlled equipment, such as heating, lamps, refrigerators, or water systems. These devices operate in an area, such as a room or a garden, that belongs to a real estate property, such as an apartment, building, or land. The smart device can be a commercial off-the-shelf unit or a DIY project composed of different components. The brain of the smart home is a smart home controller that can automate and optimize the performance of the devices.
